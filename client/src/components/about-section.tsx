                I'm a software developer with a passion for creating functional and engaging digital experiences. My journey began with a fascination for problem-solving, which has evolved into a love for building clean, maintainable, and reliable applications.

              <p>
                When I'm not coding, you'll often find me baking, reading, or exploring nature trails. These hobbies inspire my approach to developmentâ€”careful, precise, and thoughtful, creating solutions that are both effective and enjoyable to use.
              </p>
              <p>
                I enjoy building backend systems, APIs, and exploring functional programming, always aiming to write code that is sustainable and grows gracefully over time. My goal is to create applications that solve problems while bringing a touch of delight to users.
